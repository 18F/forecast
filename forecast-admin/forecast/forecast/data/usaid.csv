Egypt,Nevine Hindy,STEM Teacher Preparation Program,"In September 2011, the Egyptian Ministry of Education (MOE) introduced advanced Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, as part of its formal secondary education system, targeting gifted students who have the desire and aptitude to pursue specialized and advanced levels of science and mathematics to progress on to higher education. To-date, the MOE established nine STEM schools and is planning to establish eighteen more schools by school year 2018/2019. The planned expansion of STEM education in Egypt has already created demand for highly qualified and skilled STEM teachers who have a solid command of English language and demonstrated understanding of STEM concepts. To satisfy the needs of STEM education, USAID/Egypt is planning to fund the implementation of a STEM Teacher Preparation program, which aims at: 1. Providing pre-service teacher candidates with deep content knowledge and the ability to continually refine their STEM pedagogical skills; and 2. Supporting teachers already within the Ministry of Education?s system as they transition from teaching through traditional lecture to project-based and inquiry-based pedagogy. The program will support the expansion and sustainability of STEM education by preparing candidate teachers to deliver STEM curricula, adopt evolving STEM teaching methodologies, and engage in research and innovation, in addition to strengthening STEM in-service professional development programs. Pre-service and in-service teacher education institutions will institutionalize the development and dissemination of new STEM knowledge. USAID/Egypt recognizes that STEM teacher education requires systemic reform that will involve higher education institutions, the Ministries of Education and Higher Education, and STEM schools. Further, excellence in STEM learning involves linking professors, teachers, and students to the global knowledge economy in order to remain relevant in the ever-evolving area of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.",Education,,$25M - $49.99M,TBD,To Be Determined (TBD),N/A,2016,9/1/2016,2/21/2016,5 years,TBD,New Opportunity Not Previously Forecasted
