Egypt,Nevine Hindy,STEM Teacher Preparation Program,"In September 2011, the Egyptian Ministry of Education (MOE) introduced advanced Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, as part of its formal secondary education system, targeting gifted students who have the desire and aptitude to pursue specialized and advanced levels of science and mathematics to progress on to higher education. To-date, the MOE established nine STEM schools and is planning to establish eighteen more schools by school year 2018/2019. The planned expansion of STEM education in Egypt has already created demand for highly qualified and skilled STEM teachers who have a solid command of English language and demonstrated understanding of STEM concepts. To satisfy the needs of STEM education, USAID/Egypt is planning to fund the implementation of a STEM Teacher Preparation program, which aims at: 1. Providing pre-service teacher candidates with deep content knowledge and the ability to continually refine their STEM pedagogical skills; and 2. Supporting teachers already within the Ministry of Education?s system as they transition from teaching through traditional lecture to project-based and inquiry-based pedagogy. The program will support the expansion and sustainability of STEM education by preparing candidate teachers to deliver STEM curricula, adopt evolving STEM teaching methodologies, and engage in research and innovation, in addition to strengthening STEM in-service professional development programs. Pre-service and in-service teacher education institutions will institutionalize the development and dissemination of new STEM knowledge. USAID/Egypt recognizes that STEM teacher education requires systemic reform that will involve higher education institutions, the Ministries of Education and Higher Education, and STEM schools. Further, excellence in STEM learning involves linking professors, teachers, and students to the global knowledge economy in order to remain relevant in the ever-evolving area of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.",Education,,$25M - $49.99M,N/A,To Be Determined (TBD),N/A,2016,2017-05-01,2016-10-01,5 years,TBD,Change in Anticipated Solicitation Date,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zambia,Ali Nader,"Integrating Agriculture, Nutrition and Water and Sanitation Project","The Economic Development, Health and Education Offices propose a jointly-managed integrated agriculture, nutrition, and water and sanitation activity to reduce stunting through agricultural, water and sanitation and behavior change pathways in targeted districts of Zambia. The expected geographic focus will be in Eastern Province, potentially with selected districts in Central or Muchinga Provinces. Addressing stunting requires children and pregnant and lactating women are consuming adequate quantity, quality and diversity of food and that adequate health conditions exist for them to biologically utilize what they eat. This requires a complexity of interventions that increase access and availability of safe, diverse, nutritious food (usually relying on home production), adoption of better child feeding and women?s diets, water and hygiene practices to improve food safety and utilization, and access to clean water and a healthier, cleaner environment. This requires a multi-sectoral approach that increases incomes; improves agricultural productivity and private sector led value chain development in nutrient-dense, protein-rich foods; improves access to and availability and utilization of nutritious food, clean water, and sanitation; improves health-seeking behaviors for both the pregnant mother, as well as her child; and promotes essential nutrition and hygiene behaviors, including hand-washing, exclusive breastfeeding, appropriate complementary feeding, child spacing, and hygienic play spaces. The selected agricultural value chains should build on current Feed the Future programs and would likely choose from groundnuts, soy, cowpea, pigeon pea, orange maize, orange flesh sweet potato, African Indigenous Vegetables, and poultry, to ensure a source of protein. The water and sanitation activities should build on lessons learned from previous USAID WASH programming, promote access to and use of latrines at household level, and safe water points, CLTS and Essential Hygiene Actions and most critically, strengthen governance and private sector engagement to ensure long-term sustainability, potentially building on foundations laid in previous USAID-funded SPLASH communities. Direct nutrition interventions at households and nutrition-sensitive messaging across all sectors will be critical to the success of the project. The project will incorporate strong learning components, potentially with embedded operations and/or other evaluation approaches to address research gaps and generate lessons learned about approaches to integration.",Economic Growth and Trade,,$50M - $74.99M,N/A,To Be Determined (TBD),TBD,2017,2016-10-31,2016-08-15,5 years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
